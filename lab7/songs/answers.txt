If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

We know the average energy, valence, and danceability on Spotify top 100 songs in 2018.
So we can compare the averages with one listener's top 100 songs averages.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Dividing moods into six categories may sound reasonable, but it is not precise.
It would be more accurate to divide more and put more weight than two.
